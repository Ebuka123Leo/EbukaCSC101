	\section*{C PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE}
	C programming language was invented in 1972 by a great computer scientist called Dennis Ritchie at AT and T, US. He was working with his colleagues on an operating system called Unix using a programming language"B". This programming language was extremely fast, but he was experiencing some issues with the program and decided to invent a more efficient one. He added better features to the former and improved it generally. The result of this brand new, formerly known as "B" was named "c".
	
	Nowadays, C programming has been used to invent a lot of applications and system in our modern world such as: Microsoft Window, photoshop, Google Chromium.
